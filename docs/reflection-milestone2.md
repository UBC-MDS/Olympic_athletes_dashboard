# Reflection

### What we have implemented in our dashboard so far

Our [Olympics Athlete Dashboard](https://olympic-athletes-dash.herokuapp.com/) currently consists of:
* 4 plots: 3 histograms for athletes' `Age`, `Weight`, and `Height` distribution, with two colors to distinguish genders.
* 5 filters on the left side bar: a slider for `year` range selection, two drop-down menus for `sports` and `countries`, and two radio buttons to select medal and season.
* All the plots are on the "Plots" tab, the "Data Table" tab shows the clean data based on the selected filters. 

### What we know is not working in our dashboard

There are currently no major bugs in our dashboard. The app is working properly when filtering and all interactivity with the plots work as expected. 

### What we think our dashboard does well

The app is simple and straightforward to use, which can provide information for different user groups. The filters on the left side bar are self explanatory and an average person with no prior data science knowledge can easily operate the app to gain insights from the charts. The plots are also intuitive to read and interpret, and the filtering options work cohesively with the graphics to allow flexible and customizable plots.

### What its limitations are

Some current limitations are that users are not able to compare age, weight or height distributions across sports or across countries. The users also cannot look up information on a specific athlete, but only a summary of all athletes within a filtered subset.

### Potential future improvements and additions

Future additions include creating a new tab that will show comparisons of athlete information across different sports or countries. Another addition could be to show the break down of sports into individual events, or to add a search bar that shows the sport, event and medals of a particular athlete. We can also optimize the style and formatting of the plots, such as updating font sizes, making better axis names and plot titles, etc.

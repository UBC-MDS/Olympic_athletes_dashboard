# Reflection

### What we have implemented in our dashboard so far

Our [Olympics Athlete Dashboard](https://olympic-athletes-dash.herokuapp.com/) currently consists of 4 plots and 5 filtering functionalities. Plots include a geographical map of the world, and three histograms for `Age`, `Weight`, and `Height` distribution. Filtering options include a slider for `year` range selection and drop-down menus for `sports` and `countries`. There are also radio buttons to select medal and season.  All the plots are on the "Plots" tab, the "Data Table" tab shows the clean data based on the selected filters. The filtering functions are in the left side bar and control the outputs for both the plots and data table tabs.


### What we know is not working in our dashboard

There are currently no major bugs in our dashboard. The app is working properly when filtering and all interactivity with the plots work as expected. 

### What we think our dashboard does well and what its limitations are

The app is simple and straightforward to use. The filters on the left hand side are self explanatory and an average person with no prior data science knowledge can easily operate the app to gain insights from the charts. The plots are also intuitive to read and interpret, and the filtering options work cohesively with the graphics to allow flexible and customizable plots. Some current limitations of the app are that the user is not able to compare age, weight or height distributions across sports or across countries. The user also cannot look up information on a specific athlete, only a summary of all athletes within a filtered subset.

### Potential future improvements and additions

Future additions include creating a new tab that will show comparisons of athlete information across different sports or countries. Another addition could be to show the break down of sports into individual events, or to add a search bar that shows the sport, event and medals of a particular athlete. Style and formatting of the plots as well as updating font sizes, better axis names and plot titles are all improvements that could be made to the existing dashboard.
